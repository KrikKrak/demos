# Demos

## Intro
Still under construction. Showcase of some client-side demos.

- Backend: It's an Sails.js app. It heavily uses CoffeeScript and Stylus.
- Frontend: The main libraries used are jQuery, Lodash, D3 and Raph√§el.

## Install
You need to have Node.js installed, with Bower.

- Download the repo
- Inside the demos: `npm install` and `bower install`
- To start the server `sails lift` (I use the port 4000)
