# Demos

## Intro
Still under construction. Showcase of some client-side demos.

- Backend: It's an Sails.js app. It heavily uses CoffeeScript and Stylus.
- Frontend: The main libraries used are lodash.js, Angulajs, D3.js.

## Testing
The tests are basically functional, and just for speeding the debugging times. There are no intentions of reaching a low level unit testing.
